Hello Viewers, 

In this repository I have made two simple and effective python scripts for cracking password.

One is made for brute force attack (Brute_force.py) 

BRUTE FORCE

In cryptography, the type of attack which consists of an attacker submitting many passwords with the hope of eventually guessing correctly is called brute force.
The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.

DICTIONARY ATTACK

In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is an attack using a restricted subset of a keyspace to defeat a cipher or authentication mechanism
by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase, sometimes trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities often obtained from lists of past 
security breaches.
